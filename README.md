 <strong>PokeAPI Pokémon Fetcher (Vanilla JavaScript)</strong>

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript and demonstrates how to fetch Pokémon data from the PokeAPI in a simple and scalable way.

By default, it retrieves the first 151 Pokémon. Thanks to PokeAPI’s sequential ID system, the project can easily scale to include all available Pokémon by changing a single numeric range in one line of code.

 How It Works

Each Pokémon in PokeAPI has a unique numeric ID.
