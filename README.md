📘 PokeAPI Pokémon Fetcher (Vanilla JavaScript)

This project is built using Vanilla JavaScript and demonstrates how to fetch Pokémon data from the PokeAPI in a simple and scalable way.

By default, it retrieves the first 151 Pokémon. Thanks to PokeAPI’s sequential ID system, the project can easily scale to include all available Pokémon by changing a single numeric range in one line of code.
